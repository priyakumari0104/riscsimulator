# RISC Simulator - Visual Edition

A visual RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) simulator with a graphical user interface built using Python and Tkinter. This simulator allows you to write, assemble, and execute RISC assembly code while visualizing the state of registers and memory.

## Features

- Interactive GUI using Tkinter
- Real-time register and memory state visualization
- Assembly code editor with syntax highlighting
- Step-by-step execution capability
- Support for basic RISC instructions (INP, OUT, ADD, SUB, HLT)

## Usage

1. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   python risc_simulator_gui.py
   ```

2. Enter your assembly code in the right panel
3. Click "Assemble" to load your program
4. Use "Run All" to execute the full program or "Step" for single-step execution
5. Watch the registers and memory update in real-time

## Supported Instructions

- `INP Rx` - Input to register x
- `OUT Rx` - Output from register x
- `ADD Rd, Rs1, Rs2` - Add registers
- `SUB Rd, Rs1, Rs2` - Subtract registers
- `HLT` - Halt program execution
